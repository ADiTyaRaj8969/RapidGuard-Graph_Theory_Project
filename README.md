# 🚨 Rapid Guard - Real-Time Emergency Response System

**Rapid Guard** is a real-time incident reporting and emergency response system that leverages **graph theory algorithms** to quickly identify and notify the nearest available members during critical events. It ensures swift and efficient action through smart matching and notification logic.

---

## 💡 Objective

To enhance community safety by enabling instant reporting of emergencies and dispatching the closest responders using graph-based algorithms like **bipartite matching** and **shortest path analysis**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📝 **Incident Reporting** – Simple interface for users to report emergencies
- 🌍 **Location Analysis** – Captures and analyzes exact incident locations
- 🧭 **Shortest Path Calculation** – Determines nearest responders using graph theory
- 🔄 **Bipartite Graph Matching** – Ensures one member handles one incident at a time
- 📣 **Notification System** – Instantly notifies responders and incident head via SMS, email, or app

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Google Sites (or any basic form interface)
- **Backend Logic**: Python / PHP (customizable based on your setup)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Algorithms**: Graph Theory (Shortest Path, Bipartite Matching)

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

Rapid Guard uses:
- 📌 **Shortest Path Algorithm** to determine which responders are closest to an incident.
- 🔗 **Bipartite Graph Matching** to fairly assign members to incidents without duplication.

---

## 🖥️ System Flow

1. 🚨 **Report Incident** – A member submits details via the interface.
2. 📍 **Capture Location** – The system identifies the incident location.
3. 📊 **Analyze Members** – Uses proximity to locate nearest available responders.
4. 👥 **Assign Responders** – Matches members via a bipartite graph algorithm.
5. 📬 **Send Notifications** – Alerts are sent to selected members and admins.
